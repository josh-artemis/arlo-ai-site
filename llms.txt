# Arlo Health

> Licensed clinicians for AI health platforms. The clinical action API.

Arlo gives your AI its own clinicians. One API call to prescribe, order labs, and refer patients — in all 50 states, fully compliant.

## API Overview

Arlo provides a REST API and MCP server for creating and managing clinical encounters. Your AI identifies a clinical need, POSTs to /encounters, and a licensed clinician acts — prescriptions, lab orders, referrals.

## Core Concepts

- Encounter: A clinical interaction between a patient and a licensed clinician, initiated via API.
- Clinician: A licensed nurse practitioner or physician in the Arlo network, credentialed and malpractice-covered.
- Action: The clinical output of an encounter — a prescription sent, lab ordered, or referral placed.
- Webhook: Real-time notification when an encounter status changes or a clinician takes action.

## Endpoints

- POST /v1/encounters — Create a new clinical encounter
- GET /v1/encounters/:id — Retrieve encounter details and status
- GET /v1/encounters — List encounters with optional filters
- POST /v1/encounters/:id/cancel — Cancel a pending encounter

## Authentication

All API requests require a Bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer arlo_sk_xxxxxxxxx`
